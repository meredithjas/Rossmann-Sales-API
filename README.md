# üöÄ¬†Rossmann Sales ML  Model Building and Deployment

# **Description**

This is an end-to-end machine learning project which makes use of Rossmann Sales dataset to predict sales. The project is composed of 3 tasks: **Model Building**, **Flask API Creation**, **CI/CD Model Deployment Pipeline**.

---

# Model Building

Random Forest Regressor was used for the model.  Its ability to construct multiple decision trees makes it a good model that can handle large amounts of data, as well as the volatility of the data. Since it is trained on a random subset and features of the training data, the algorithm can still efficiently and accurately make predictions.

## Data Exploration

Two datasets were given: Train and Store. However, according to our sales prediction problem, the input values are `Store, DayOfWeek, Date, Customers, Open, Promo, StateHoliday, SchoolHoliday, and Sales`. As such, we‚Äôll only consider **Train** dataset.

## Feature Engineering

- Split `Date` column to `Year, Month, Day`
- Converted `StateHoliday` values to int counterpart

## Train-Test Split

The dataset was split into 80-20 for training and testing sets.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

A Grid Search was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the decision tree regressor model. A range of values was specified for each hyperparameter, and used grid search to evaluate all possible combinations of hyperparameters within that range. A total of three grid searches were generated. However, since setting `max_depth` to `None` yielded a heavy model, only the two grid searches were considered:

```python
grid_space_1 = {
	'max_depth':[3,7,10],
	'n_estimators':[5,10,20],
	'max_features':[1,5,7],
	'min_samples_leaf':[1,2,3],
	'min_samples_split':[1,2,3]
}
```

```python
grid_space_2 = {
	'max_depth':[10],
	'n_estimators':[20,50,100],
	'max_features':[7,8],
	'min_samples_leaf':[2],
	'min_samples_split':[3,4]
}
```

There were 243 and 12 tests generated, respectively.

## Final Model

The model with hyperparameters:

**{'max_depth': 10, 'max_features': 8, 'min_samples_leaf': 2, 'min_samples_split': 4, 'n_estimators': 50}**

yielded the best score of **`89.48`**

# Flask API Creation

A Flask API was developed to serve the machine learning model.

## Endpoints

The model API can be accessed through the endpoint */predict* which calls a POST request.

```bash
POST: http://localhost:5000/predict
```

A health check endpoint */health* can also be accessed.

```bash
GET: http://localhost:5000/health
```

This will simply print `‚ÄúWelcome to Rossmann Sales API!‚Äù`

## Parameters

The API accepts eight parameters: **Store**, **DayOfWeek**, **Date**, **Customers**, **Open**, **Promo**, **StateHoliday**, **SchoolHoliday** in JSON format, and outputs a JSON object that contains the **Sales** prediction in data type float.

| Parameter | Type | Sample | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Store | int | 1111 |  |
| DayOfWeek | int | 4 |  |
| Date | str | ‚Äú2014-07-10‚Äù |  |
| Customers | int | 4100 |  |
| Open | int | 1 | only accepts 1 |
| Promo | int | 1 |  |
| StateHoliday | str | ‚Äúa‚Äù | string = ‚Äúa‚Äù ‚Äúb‚Äù ‚Äúc‚Äù ‚Äú0‚Äù; int = 0 |
| SchoolHoliday | int | 1 |  |

<aside>
üí° The API only accepts **Open** with value of **1** since closed stores from refurbishment will have no sales.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° The API only accepts StateHoliday values of string ‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúb‚Äù, ‚Äúc‚Äù,‚Äù0‚Äù and int 0

</aside>

### Sample Request and Response 1:

Here is a sample input and output request in JSON format:

```json

{
    "Store":1111,
    "DayOfWeek":4,
    "Date":"2014-07-10",
    "Customers":4100,
    "Open":1,
    "Promo":1,
    "StateHoliday":"a",
    "SchoolHoliday":1
}
```

will output:

```python
{
    "sales": 25565.772841401882
}
```

### Sample Request and Response 2 (closed store):

```python
{
    "Store":1111,
    "DayOfWeek":4,
    "Date":"2014-07-10",
    "Customers":4100,
    "Open":0,
    "Promo":0,
    "StateHoliday":"0",
    "SchoolHoliday":1
}
```

```python
{
    "error": "ERROR: Store should be open.",
    "status": 400
}
```

### Sample Request and Response 3 (invalid StateHoliday):

```python
{
    "Store":1111,
    "DayOfWeek":4,
    "Date":"2014-07-10",
    "Customers":4100,
    "Open":1,
    "Promo":0,
    "StateHoliday":"z",
    "SchoolHoliday":1
}
```

```python
{
    "error": "ERROR: State Holiday unknown.",
    "status": 400
}
```

## Running the API Locally

Before running the API, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies in the **requirements.txt** file in the root folder.

```python
$ virtualenv API
$ source API/bin/activate
(API)$ pip3 install -r path/to/requirements.txt
```

Run the python file **app.py** in the root folder using the virtual environment:

```python
(API)$ python3 app.py
```

# **CI/CD Model Deployment Pipeline**

The CI/CD Model Deployment pipeline is made from Github Actions Workflow yaml files. It contains **Linter**, **Deployment to Heroku**, **Test API**

## Containerization using Dockerfile and Heroku

The `Dockerfile` specifies the necessary dependencies and commands for running the application. This is used to build the application container that will be deployed to Heroku. A `heroku.yaml` and `Procfile` is also needed for the deployment.

See code for more details

## Github Actions

There are two workflows in the project: `Lint` and `Deploy to Heroku`

- `Lint` checks all push and pull requests to all branches to ensure code quality
- `Deploy to Heroku` contains the following:
    - built-in linter as well
    - deployment proper
    - running the test script

### Linter

Runs the pre-commit hook to check for linting issues.

See code for more details

### Deployment to Heroku

Deploys the docker container to heroku. Makes use of [gonuit/heroku-docker-deploy@v1.3.3](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-push-and-release-a-docker-container-to-heroku?version=v1.3.3) from Github Marketplace.

See code for more details

### Test API

After deployment, this runs the test script from `test` folder to ensure that the deployed model to heroku is working as expected.

See code for more details
